Practical 2 required us to use Joomla to create another startup website. As for this task, my view is that we should create two websites, which I think is to make two websites with different purposes for our own entrepreneurial needs. For example, one website is used to attract local customers, and another website is used to attract other customers, so as to achieve commercial promotion.

In the process of using Joomla, you must first install and configure the server to ensure that it meets the requirements. In-depth understanding of the background management interface, familiar with the management of different functional areas, including menus, components, modules and plug-ins. Choose the template with the right theme, and personalize it, adjust the color, font, etc., to meet the brand needs.
A key step in Joomla's content management is to understand and become proficient with its core concepts, including articles, categories, and labeling. Through a reasonable classification structure, you can organize and display website content more effectively. For articles, Joomla offers a powerful editor that allows users to easily create rich text content while inserting multimedia elements such as images and videos to enrich the presentation of the page. The use of categories helps to organize content in an orderly way, allowing users to easily find topics of interest to them. Tags provide a flexible way to link related content together through keywords, improving the overall information retrieval and browsing experience. In using Joomla, I have been impressed by its flexibility and extensibility, which can be adapted to various website types and easily extended through plug-ins and modules. The learning curve may be a little steep, but once mastered, you'll find that you can deeply customize your website to meet almost any need. The support of the Joomla community is an invaluable resource and has also played a key role in continuous learning and updating, enabling me to keep the site safe and functional.

In addition, I use the Cloud Control Panel (CCP) for administration and domain name creation when using Joomla. The Cloud Control Panel is a key tool for cloud service providers to provide users with user-friendly features that make it easy to understand and operate even for users who lack in-depth technical knowledge. The control panel allows users to intuitively manage cloud resources, including VMS, storage, and databases, and flexibly configure resources. Its monitoring and reporting functions help users learn about resource performance and cost usage in real time, and provide support for optimal configuration and troubleshooting. In terms of security, it provides authentication, access control, encryption and other levels of protection to ensure the security of user data and resources. Automation and extensibility enable users to operate and integrate more efficiently through scripts and apis. Cross-platform compatibility provides users with the flexibility to access and manage cloud resources on different devices and operating systems. Overall, the Cloud Control Panel provides users with an intuitive, easy, and secure way to unlock the potential of cloud computing, optimize resource management, and increase efficiency.

The entire self-learning and working time is about 25h. Here are some of my learning resources:
